*Finding trends and insights in products and sales data*

REC corp LTD. is small-scaled business venture established in India. They have been selling FOUR PRODUCTS for OVER TEN YEARS .

The products are P1, P2, P3 and P4.

They have collected data from their retail centers and organized it into a small csv file , which has been given to me.

**The excel file contains about 8 numerical parameters :**

* Q1- Total unit sales of product 1
* Q2- Total unit sales of product 2
* Q3- Total unit sales of product 3
* Q4- Total unit sales of product 4
* S1- Total revenue from product 1
* S2- Total revenue from product 2
* S3- Total revenue from product 3
* S4- Total revenue from product 4

Example:

On 13-06-2010 , product 1 had been brought by 5422 people and INR 17187.74 had been generated in revenue from product 1.

## Project Objectives

**Now , REC corp needs me to solve the following questions :**

1. Is there any trend in the sales of all four products during certain months?

2. Out of all four products , which product has seen the highest sales in all the given years?

3. The company has all it's retail centers closed on the 31st of December every year. Mr: Hariharan, the CEO, would love to get an estimate on number of units of each product that could be sold on 31st of Dec, every year, if all their retail centers were kept open.

4. The CEO is considering an idea to drop the production of any one of the products. He wants me to analyze this data and suggest whether his idea would result in a massive setback for the company.

5. The CEO would also like to predict the sales and revenues for the year 2024. He wants me to give a yearly estimate with the best possible accuracy.
